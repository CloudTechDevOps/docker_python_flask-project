Note:
nohup stands for "no hang up". It allows you to run a command that keeps running even after you log out or close your terminal session.

Start your Flask application with nohup:

## To run continuously  background without stop

nohup python3 app.py > flask.log 2>&1 &


ps aux | grep app.py   # to check running or not python background


pkill -f app.py    # to kill process 


### How It Works
nohup prevents the process from stopping when you log out.
& runs it in the background.
> flask.log 2>&1 redirects output (stdout & stderr) to flask.log.
